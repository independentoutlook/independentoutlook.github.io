            <h1>2020 election</h1>
            <p><img src="/images/2020-election.webp" alt=""></p>
<p>The 2020 U.S. presidential election took place on November 3, 2020, amidst the COVID-19 pandemic and heightened political tensions. The election was one of the most contentious in U.S. history, with high voter turnout and a record number of mail-in ballots due to the pandemic. The primary candidates were the incumbent Republican President Donald J. Trump and Democratic challenger Joseph R. Biden Jr., who had served as Vice President under President Barack Obama.</p>
<p>Joe Biden emerged as the winner of the election, securing 306 electoral votes compared to Trump’s 232. Biden also won the popular vote by a significant margin, receiving over 81 million votes (51.3%) to Trump’s 74 million (46.8%). His victory marked a significant shift in the political landscape, as he flipped key battleground states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, which Trump had won in 2016.</p>
<p>The election was defined by several key issues, including the federal government’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, economic recovery, racial justice, and climate change. Biden campaigned on a platform of unity, rebuilding the middle class, and addressing systemic inequities. In contrast, Trump emphasized his administration&rsquo;s economic achievements, deregulation efforts, and strong stance on immigration.</p>
<p>The election also saw an unprecedented level of early voting and mail-in voting, with over 100 million Americans casting their ballots before Election Day. This shift was largely driven by safety concerns due to the pandemic. Election officials in many states had to adapt quickly to handle the surge in absentee ballots, leading to delayed results in several states.</p>
<p>Despite the challenges, the 2020 election was widely regarded as secure and free of widespread fraud. However, Trump and many of his supporters contested the results, alleging election irregularities and voter fraud. These claims were repeatedly dismissed by state and federal courts, as well as by independent election observers.</p>
<p>The post-election period was marked by significant political turmoil. Trump refused to concede, and his administration pursued multiple legal challenges in an attempt to overturn the results. These efforts culminated in the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot, when a mob of Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol during the certification of the Electoral College results.</p>
<p>The events surrounding the election and its aftermath highlighted deep divisions within the United States. They also underscored the fragility of democratic institutions and the importance of maintaining public trust in the electoral process. Biden’s inauguration on January 20, 2021, took place under unprecedented security measures.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the 2020 election was a defining moment in modern American history. It underscored the resilience of the democratic system, even in the face of significant challenges. Biden’s presidency began with a focus on healing the nation’s divisions, addressing the pandemic, and advancing key legislative priorities.</p>
