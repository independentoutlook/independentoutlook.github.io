Upon taking office in January 2009, Obama inherited an economy in deep recession, with high unemployment, a banking system in disarray, and a federal deficit that had grown significantly due to the crisis. His administration&amp;rsquo;s economic policies focused on stabilizing the financial system, creating jobs, and stimulating economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/trump.webp&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump&amp;rsquo;s presidency (2017-2021) brought significant changes to the U.S. economy, driven by policies aimed at stimulating growth, reducing regulations, and shifting the tax landscape. The economy performed well during much of his tenure, with strong stock market performance and low unemployment. However, his economic legacy remains a subject of debate, as some argue his policies led to short-term gains while potentially exacerbating long-term challenges such as income inequality and national debt.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
